Kansas prohibited all alcohol from 1881 to 1948, and continued to prohibit on-premises sales of alcohol from 1949 to 1987. Sunday sales only have been allowed since 2005. Today, 29 counties still do not permit the on-premises sale of alcohol. 59 counties require a business to receive at least 30% of revenue from food sales to allow on-premises sale of alcohol. Only 17 counties allow general on-premises sales. Not all communities which allow off-premises sales allow sales on Sunday. Sales are prohibited on Christmas and Easter.

Different states will have different statutes of limitations regarding who can sell alcohol and who can purchase alcohol. The federal government formally defines an alcoholic beverage as any beverage containing over 0.05 percent alcohol, and most states honor this limit; however, there may be some variability within certain states and localities.

A minor is anyone under the age of majority, 18 in most states. Since possession of alcohol is an act of juvenile delinquency, for example, providing alcohol to minors would be an act of CDM in most cases. Colorado was the first to establish the crime in 1903 and all states now have such laws, even though most have carved out some exceptions.

The legal age to drink alcohol is 21 in all states. Establishments that do not check the identification of individuals who appear to 30 or younger are at risk for losing their liquor license. In addition, actually selling alcohol to an individual under the age of 21 is a sure way for a business to lose its liquor license. Some states may even encourage servers or bartenders to ask the individual questions if it is suspected that the person’s identification may be falsified or that the ID belongs to another person. The risk is all on the establishment that serves the minor. Businesses that serve minors who go on to injure someone, cause property damage, or result in a death while they are intoxicated will most assuredly lose their liquor license.

Penalties for convicted arsonists vary in every jurisdiction, and generally become more severe based upon the degree to which the fire puts human life at risk.

The penalties associated with a conviction of arson vary widely depending on the degree of arson. For example, the New York Penal Law includes five possible degrees of arson, where the fifth degree is a class A misdemeanor punishable by no more than year in jail, and the first degree is a class A-1 felony carrying a minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum sentence of 25 years.

In general, to commit arson, someone starting a fire must mean to start it with the knowledge that property damage is likely to result. On the other hand, accidentally burning property often isn’t a crime. In some states, though, a person who  ly starts a fire that causes property damage or hurts someone can be convicted of arson. Disobeying local fire ordinances, such as those restricting bonfires or campfires, can also lead to arson charges if the fire spreads and causes damage.

An arsonist can use a match, a lighter, or even explosives to directly set property on fire. But someone who indirectly sets a fire can also be convicted of arson. Suppose, for instance, a man starts a fire in one building while intending for it to spread and damage a neighboring building. The man can be convicted of arson for burning the second building even though he didn’t directly ignite it.

Instead, a person need only have an intent to contact or cause contact with an individual.

The breaking-in can occur in two ways: actual and constructive. Actual breaking involves physical force: picking a lock or kicking a door in, for example. It could even be a very slight use of force, such as pushing open a door that's been left ajar. Constructive breaking, on the other hand, involves methods of gaining entry that don't use physical force fraud, for example. No matter how burglars break in, they must also enter the structure in order to satisfy this element. The entry can be minimal; the burglar doesn't have to actually walk into a building in order to commit a burglary. Sticking a hand through a window counts as an entry sufficient to support a charge of burglary. It's also important to note that the entry has to occur without the consent of the person occupying the property.

This means that the building must be either a private one or a public one that was not open or otherwise publicly accessible. Illegal entry also applies to a person who enters a structure that’s open to the public, but with the intent to commit a crime inside—like a person who walks into a store with the intent to steal merchandise. The reasoning is that the owner’s permission has been extended only to those who enter for legitimate purposes; when the thief entered for illegal purposes, that permission did not apply, and the entry became one without permission.

Today, the law prohibits anyone from entering into any structure, and not just a home. Many state laws identify the types of structures that count as a building for burglary crimes. They include stores, school buildings, houseboats, trailer homes, and even tents or campsites. Some states also differentiate between burglary of a commercial space and residential burglary, punishing residential burglary more harshly. For residential burglary, the building must be a home, apartment, or some type of building in which a person lives.

To have charges issued, the youth does not need to be directly harmed by the actions of the accused. The young person or persons only must be present in an environment where they may be injured physically, emotionally or mentally. Leaving a child in an unsafe neighborhood could be considered a violation that is child endangerment. Convictions of these charges often result in a minimum of one year through a maximum of six years. However, some states have lesser and greater degrees of penalties with other numerous factors to consider. Many common factors of these crimes have the same fines, fees and prison terms attached, but when the violation becomes a felony, these penalties are usually elevated with the crime classification.

Leaving a young one in a car for long periods of time, or when the temperature is very hot and the child is inside the vehicle would be considered this violation. This is due to the issues of heat exhaustion, overheating, possible injuries due to burns and similar issues. Leaving a person in such a situation has been deemed possibly life-threatening. Allowing a child to be alone in an area where he or she could be kidnapped or abducted is usually considered dangerous and possibly hazardous. These actions could also place the young one in danger from moving vehicles or other dangers. driving while intoxicated, providing a minor with alcohol and letting them drive are all considered possible child endangerment crimes in many jurisdictions. Each poses a possible danger to the potential risk of injury whether physical, emotional or mental. Even the possibility of harm may be interpreted to be an offense of child endangerment.

Section 2256 of Title 18, United States Code, defines child pornography as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor (someone under 18 years of age).  Visual depictions include photographs, videos, digital or computer generated images indistinguishable from an actual minor, and images created, adapted, or modified, but appear to depict an identifiable, actual minor.  Undeveloped film, undeveloped videotape, and electronically stored data that can be converted into a visual image of child pornography are also deemed illegal visual depictions under federal law.

A picture of a naked child may constitute illegal child pornography if it is sufficiently sexually suggestive.  Additionally, the age of consent for sexual activity in a given state is irrelevant; any depiction of a minor under 18 years of age engaging in sexually explicit conduct is illegal. Federal law prohibits the production, distribution, reception, and possession of an image of child pornography using or affecting any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce (See 18 U.S.C.  2251; 18 U.S.C.  2252; 18 U.S.C.  2252A).  Specifically, Section 2251 makes it illegal to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for purposes of producing visual depictions of that conduct.  Any individual who attempts or conspires to commit a child pornography offense is also subject to prosecution under federal law.

A first time offender convicted of transporting child pornography in interstate or foreign commerce under 18 U.S.C.  2252, faces fines and a statutory minimum of 5 years to 20 years maximum in prison.  Convicted offenders may face harsher penalties if the offender has prior convictions or if the child pornography offense occurred in aggravated situations defined as (i) the images are violent, sadistic, or masochistic in nature, (ii) the minor was sexually abused, or (iii) the offender has prior convictions for child sexual exploitation.

These matters are therefore generally handled by state or local authorities and prosecuted under state laws.  However, if the sexual abuse of a child occurred on federal lands, the offense may be prosecuted under federal law.  Federal lands include areas such as military bases, Indian territories, and other government– owned lands or properties (See 18 U.S.C. 7). Under federal law, offenders convicted of sexually abusing a child face fines and imprisonment.  Furthermore, an offender may face harsher penalties if the crime occurred in aggravated circumstances, which include, for example, the offender used force or threats, inflicted serious bodily injury or death, or kidnapped a child in the process of committing child sexual abuse.

Probation officers have broad discretion to issue a warning, or require you to appear in court for a probation violation hearing. In deciding, a probation officer may consider the severity and type of condition violated, past probation violations or warnings, and other considerations.

The victim can ask the police or the court, or both, depending on the violation, to enforce the order. The police can generally enforce the stay away, no contact, cease abuse, exclusive use, and possibly custody provisions - those that need immediate response. If you are unable to call them when the violation occurs, they should take a report if you call them soon afterwards. In some cases, it might result in a misdemeanor or felony criminal conviction and punishment. These types of violations can also later be addressed by the civil court, and it is often a good idea to bring them to the court’s.

If you file a “motion for contempt” in the court that issued the order, explaining how the abuser violated the order, the court will hold a hearing to determine if the facts prove that the abuser violated the order. If the court finds a violation did occur, the judge will determine a penalty. Depending upon the laws of your jurisdiction and the nature of the violation, the penalty might be a finding of contempt, which could result in a fine, jail time or both. The violation might also be a reason for the order to be extended or modified in some way.

When a person faces the courtroom for a violation hearing, he or she may not understand what this entails. The prosecuting lawyer does not need the same beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt in charging the person with the violation and succeeding in the judge’s positive decision to penalize the violator. This places the burden of proving the allegations false or providing a reasonable accounting for violating probation. Without legal representation, the individual may fail at giving his or her reasons for violating the probation or in refuting the charges successfully. Then, the person may face additional sentencing or a loss of probation entirely.

However, the circumstances of each case often determine whether a prosecutor charges the accused with assault, battery, disorderly conduct, or more serious charges. Protests: While engaging in peaceful protests is a constitutionally protected right, engaging in disruptive protests is not. For example, courts have held that participants in a sit-in demonstration engaged in disorderly conduct because they blocked traffic on a pedestrian walkway. Disturbing an assembly: Interrupting a city council meeting, a public rally, or religious ceremony can be enough to qualify as disorderly conduct. Public misconduct: Engaging in what is normally private conduct in a public place is often charged as disorderly conduct. Public urination, public masturbation, and public intoxication can constitute disorderly conduct. Police encounters: Many disorderly conduct charges arise from encounters people have with the police. For example, while arguing with a police officer does not count as disorderly conduct, arguing with police while engaging in threatening conduct or using any type of physical contact does. A person who fails to comply with a police order to move away from a public area also doesn't typically engage in disorderly conduct, unless the police officer issued the order in a situation where crowd control was an issue.

Every state and U.S. territory has laws that allow its courts to issue protection orders, as do many tribal lands. Each state, territory or tribe decides for itself how to define domestic violence and how its laws will help and protect victims, so the laws are different from one state to another. Most states include dating violence in their restraining order laws. In Georgia and South Carolina, the dating couple must have a child together or live together at some point.1 Although you may be a victim of domestic violence or dating violence, the laws in your state may be written in a way that does not include or protect you

For example, Idaho recognizes an Oregon permit, but Oregon does not recognize an Idaho permit. Florida issues a license to carry both concealed weapons and firearms, but others license only the concealed carry of firearms. Some states do not recognize out-of-state permits to carry a firearm at all, so it is important to understand the laws of each state when traveling with a handgun

Generally long guns such as shotguns or rifles are primarily used for such sports, and thus meet far less restriction in regards to permits, licenses, or registration requirements. Unlike handguns,which are responsible for roughly 70% of annual firearm homicides, shotguns have a surprisingly small effect on our country's violent crime statistics. The loose laws pertaining to shotguns, thus stem from both necessity, and tradition. Similar to other classifications of firearms, shotguns are regulated by varying state and Federal governments. Regulations on a federal level for shotguns pertain to length, barrel size, firing rates, and caliber. The length of a shotgun barrel for instance must be at least 18.5 inches or else the firearm is classified as a short barreled shotgun, and deemed illegal under the National Firearms act of 1934. Shotguns with semi-automatic or fully automatic capabilities are also regulated under the National Firearms act of 1934 and require special permits for purchase by an ordinary citizen. Shotguns used by police enforcement or the military are also federally regulated and require special taxes, background checks, training tests, and a justifiable reason to own such a weapon. The federal government acts as a broad umbrella for gun laws; it simply regulates those firearms which have no justification for use in society.

For example, the components of a silencer are considered as silencers by themselves and the replacement parts are regulated. However, the repair of original parts without replacement can be done by the original manufacturer, FFL gunsmith, or by registered owner without being subjected to new registration as long as the serial number and the dimension (caliber) are maintained.[14] The length may be reduced in repair, but cannot be increased. Increasing the length is considered as making a new silencer. Suppressor is the term used within the trade/industry literature while the term silencer is the commonly used term that appears in the actual wording of the NFA. The terms are often used interchangeably depending on the source quoted.

If a person pretends to be another, that is false impersonation. However, most false impersonation happens online as impersonators find it easier to impersonate with anonymity. Mail fraud is one of the most common federal criminal charges. The use of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) or a private interstate carrier to commit a crime of deceit gives feds an easy opportunity to claim jurisdiction. The following article provides a definition of this crime and a discussion of two of the most famous mail fraud convictions in history.

Check fraud specifically may involve signing another person’s name to a check, forging a signed endorsement or signature on a check, altering the writing on a check, constructing a fake check, or purposely writing bad checks to merchants. Check fraud laws may also vary state to state. Depending on the severity of the crime, the law may consider the forger guilty of a misdemeanor or felony. In court, check fraud or forgery must be proven with the intent to defraud another person or institution through writing fictitiously. In order for prosecution to be continued, it is not required that there be proven injury to an innocent party. Practically every US state has passed a law declaring forgery to be illegal and punishable and Congress has also passed its own legislation pertaining to the crime. .

But issues can and do arise in criminal court that allow defendants to escape conviction.

The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA) did not specifically prohibit online gambling; instead, it outlawed financial transactions involving online gambling service providers. Some offshore gambling providers reacted by shutting down their services for US customers. Other operators, however, have continued to circumvent UIGEA and have continued to service US customers. For this reason, UIGEA has received criticism from notable figures within the gambling industry

Each state has enacted different laws pertaining to these topics. The states also have differing legal gambling ages, with some states requiring the same minimum age for all types of gambling, while for others, it depends on the activity. For example, in New Jersey, an 18-year-old can buy a lottery ticket or bet on a horse race, but cannot enter a casino until age 21. Presumably, the age 21 restriction is due to the sale of alcohol in that location.

Generally, proof of actual fear is not required in order to establish intimidation. It may be inferred from conduct, words, or circumstances reasonably calculated to produce fear. Extortion (also called shakedown, and, in a legal sense incorrectly, exaction) is obtaining benefit through coercion. In most jurisdictions it is likely to constitute a criminal offense, the bulk of this article deals with such cases. Extortion is sometimes called the protection racket since the racketeers often phrase their demands as payment for protection from (real or hypothetical) threats from unspecified other parties; though often, and almost always, such protection is simply abstinence of harm from the same party, and such is implied in the protection offer. Extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime. In some jurisdictions, actually obtaining the benefit is not required to commit the offense, and making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense.[1] Exaction refers not only to extortion or the demanding and obtaining of something through force,[2] but additionally, in its formal definition, means the infliction of something such as pain and suffering or making somebody endure something unpleasant.[3]

In addition to the direct cost of litter removal, litter also harms the environment, property values and other economic activity. The most common types of litter are food packaging, bottles, cans, plastic bags, paper and tobacco products. States can discourage littering through a variety of methods, one of which is to create and enforce criminal penalties that punish unwanted behavior. While all states have some type of litter law, penalties vary widely, based on the amount, type, and location of litter. In 10 states, for example, the weight or volume of litter determines the severity of the crime. Other states focus on the type of litter, imposing penalties for dumping large items, such as furniture or major appliances. Many states have also enacted legislation to address littering in certain places, such as public highways, coastal areas, and recreational areas.

All three are part of a comprehensive response to environmental violators, write Epstein and Hammett, researchers for the United States Department of Justice. Littering and dumping laws, found in all fifty United States, appear to take precedence over municipal ordinances in controlling violations and act as public safety, not aesthetic measures. Similar from state-to-state, these laws define who violators are, the type or function of the person committing the action, and what items must be littered or dumped to constitute an illegal act. Municipal ordinances and state statutes require a human action in committing illegal littering or dumping, for one to be held in violation. Most states require law enforcement officers or designated, authorized individuals, to ...witness the illegal act to write a citation. Together, prosecutions and punitive fines are important in fighting illegal littering and dumping.

Voluntary manslaughter is defined as the unlawful and intentional killing of another human being, without malice or deliberation, upon a sudden heat of passion caused by adequate provocation. Of these several elements, the defining characteristic of voluntary manslaughter is the requirement that the killing be committed upon a sudden heat of passion.

Most states have varying degrees of murder and manslaughter, such as premeditated (or first degree murder), or murder committed during the commission of another crime (sometimes called felony murder). Not all states have adopted the Model Penal Code to classify different types of murder. Nevertheless, it serves as the basis of the criminal codes of 2/3 of the states in the U.S.

These are often referred to as crimes of passion. A common example is the jealous husband that flies into a homicidal rage and kills his wife and her lover when he finds them in bed together. Some states also consider grossly wanton behavior that results in the death of another to be second degree murder. This applies in situations where one's actions were so wanton that the death of another person was almost assured, even if the killing was not intentional. Second degree murder is also very serious, and in most situations the defendant could face decades to life in prison, though the death sentence is not a possibility in these cases.

This avoids the need to list all substances covered by a particular law within the text of the law itself. It also provides a convenient means for updating drug laws within a jurisdiction all at once, as individual drugs can be added or removed from the schedules as necessary without the need to amend all the other drug laws. For example, in the year 2000, Congress added the date-rape drug GHB to Schedule I, thereby automatically making it illegal under every federal drug law that references that schedule.

Municipal governments can institute highly specific zoning ordinances often to control the nature of a district or neighborhood. For example, zoning ordinances could be used to preserve an aesthetic for all the buildings in the area. If the municipality wishes to maintain a historic part of town, zoning ordinances could limit real estate there to buildings of comparable height and square footage as the historic buildings.

Barnes v. Glen Theatre, 501 U.S. 560, 568 (1991). Sexual activity in public is illegal throughout the U.S., but states and localities differ on what constitutes illegal public nudity, both in terms of what body parts are considered indecent and whether that state must prove that a defendant had a particular intent.

People may choose fields, bushes, forests, ditches, canals or other open space for defecation. They do so because either they do not have a toilet readily accessible or due to traditional cultural practices.[1] The practice is common where sanitation infrastructure and services are not available. Even if toilets are available, behavior change efforts may still be needed to promote the use of toilets. The term open defecation free (ODF) is used to describe communities that have shifted to using a toilet instead of open defecation. This can happen for example after community-led total sanitation programs have been implemented.

He also advocated for slow traffic to remain on the right side and for cars to pass on the left, the use of one way streets, and the construction of safety islands between opposing lanes of traffic. Many of his ideas were gradually adopted as states developed their own traffic codes. A headlamp is a lamp attached to the front of a vehicle to illuminate the road ahead. Headlamps are also often called headlights, but in the most precise usage, headlamp is the term for the device itself and headlight is the term for the beam of light produced and distributed by the device.

Tags will be issued at registration. Vehicles are required to display two current tags, one on the front and the other on the rear of the vehicle. While each state has its own traffic code, there are only slight variations from one state to the next on the major rules of the road. For example, all states use the same or similar types of traffic signs. But the maximum speed limit on freeways differs substantially from state to state, with one section of freeway in Texas boasting an 85 miles per hour limit. Below are some examples of common traffic law violations U.S. seat belt laws may be subject to primary enforcement or secondary enforcement. Primary enforcement allows a police officer to stop and ticket a driver if he or she observes a violation. Secondary enforcement means that a police officer may only stop or cite a driver for a seat belt violation if the driver committed another primary violation (such as speeding, running a stop sign, etc.) at the same time. New Hampshire is the only U.S. state that does not by law require adult drivers to wear safety belts while operating a motor vehicle.  Kansas vehicle customers will be able to renew their tags online on the last day of the month without worry of a ticket for expired car registration
